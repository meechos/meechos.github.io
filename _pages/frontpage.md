I am a neuroengineer and AI scientist with a background in physics and digital signal processing. I am interested in decoding brain function using data driven paradigms in order to inform Large Scale Models.
I am the developer of [Neurocraft, the Microscale Neuroengineering Platform](https://github.com/Neurocraft/neurocraft).
